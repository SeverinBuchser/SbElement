# SbElement

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.1. It is a component library constructed around the SCSS library [Sb-Theming](https://github.com/SeverinBuchser/SbTheming) and supports [Angular Schematics](https://angular.io/guide/schematics).

## Installation

### Angular Schematics

For the **automatic and way simpler** installation, you can use angular schematics

```bash
ng add sb-element
```

And that's it, angular will take care of the rest and install the necessary packages and update your workspace.

### Manual

For the **manual** Installation follow these steps:

1. Install packages:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev sb-element
   npm install --save-dev sb-theming
   ```

2. Include the theming files into your Angular CLI project. For this, follow the installation documentation [here](https://github.com/SeverinBuchser/SbTheming#readme).

3. You are good to go!

## Documentation

Documentation is not yet available for this project.  If you would like to look into the package yourself, checkout the [SbElement GitHub Page](https://github.com/SeverinBuchser/SbElement). There is a `TestApp` application (located in the `src` directory), which is implementing the library.
