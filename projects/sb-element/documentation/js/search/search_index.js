The component also needs to implement the\nAlertServiceSubscriber interface so the service can inform the\nsubscriber about the incoming alerts.\nIf a component wants to create an alert, the service provides different\nmethods which have predefined colors. The different methods take a message\nwhich is a string and an optional size parameter, which is also a\nstring. The methods then passes the alert to the\nAlertServiceSubscriber with a predefinded color. There is also a\nmethod, which lets you customize everything: alert. All these\nmethods then add the created alert to the alertQueue,\nand then call work. This method times the alerts and then\ninforms the subscriber when a alert needs to be shown (when an alert is\nready to be shown).\nThe lifecycle of an Alert inside the service:\n\nThe Alert gets created via a create call (like\nalert).\nThe Alert gets placed into the alertQueue.\nThe work method then removes an Alert out of the\nqueue and tells the subscribers to show the removed Alert. The\nAlert gets collected by the garbage collector after the Alert\nhas been shown.\nIf all subscribers have finished showing the Alert, the work\nmethod checks if the alertQueue is empty or not. If the\nqueue is empty, the work method terminates. If not, go to step\n3 again.\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                        Properties\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                    Private\n                                alertQueue\n                            \n                            \n                                    Private\n                                isBusy\n                            \n                            \n                                    Private\n                                subscribers\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        Methods\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                alert\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                inform\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                primary\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                secondary\n                            \n                            \n                                    Private\n                                    Async\n                                showAlert\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                subscribe\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                success\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                warn\n                            \n                            \n                                    Private\n                                    Async\n                                work\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n            \n    \n    \n        Methods\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Public\n                            alert\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                    alert(message: string, size: string, color: string)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/lib/services/alert/alert.service.ts:136\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Creates and shows an Alert.\nThe message, size and color of the Alert can be specified as\nparameters.

service to display alerts.\n *\n * The alert service can be used by any component which either whishes to show\n * or to create an alert to be shown.\n *\n * If a component wants to show alerts, the\n * component has to call [subscribe]{@link #subscribe} with the component as the\n * parameter. The component also needs to implement the\n * {@link AlertServiceSubscriber} interface so the service can inform the\n * subscriber about the incoming alerts.\n *\n * If a component wants to create an alert, the service provides different\n * methods which have predefined colors. The different methods take a `message`\n * which is a `string` and an optional `size` parameter, which is also a\n * `string`. The methods then passes the alert to the\n * {@link AlertServiceSubscriber} with a predefinded color. There is also a\n * method, which lets you customize everything: [alert]{@link #alert}. All these\n * methods then add the created alert to the [alertQueue]{@link #alertQueue},\n * and then call [work]{@link #work}. This method times the alerts and then\n * informs the subscriber when a alert needs to be shown (when an alert is\n * ready to be shown).\n *\n * The lifecycle of an {@link Alert} inside the service:\n * 1. The {@link Alert} gets created via a create call (like\n * [alert]{@link #alert}).\n * 2. The {@link Alert} gets placed into the [alertQueue]{@link #alertQueue}.\n * 3. The [work]{@link #work} method then removes an {@link Alert} out of the\n * queue and tells the subscribers to show the removed {@link Alert}. The\n * {@link Alert} gets collected by the garbage collector after the {@link Alert}\n * has been shown.\n * 4. If all subscribers have finished showing the {@link Alert}, the work\n * method checks if the [alertQueue]{@link #alertQueue} is empty or not. If the\n * queue is empty, the [work]{@link #work} method terminates. If not, go to step\n * 3 again.\n *\n */\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AlertService {\n\n  /**\n   * An array of all subscribers.\n   */\n  private subscribers: Array\n    = new Array();\n\n  /**\n   * The queue of all [Alerts]{@link Alert} which need to be shown.\n   */\n  private alertQueue: Queue = new Queue();\n\n  /**\n   * Flag to inidcate if the service is busy working on the\n   * [alertQueue]{@link #alertQueue} or not.\n   */\n  private isBusy: boolean = false;\n\n  /**\n   * Adds a new subscriber into [subscribers]{@link #subscribers}.\n   *\n   * @param{AlertServiceSubscriber} subscriber The new subscriber\n   */\n  public subscribe(subscriber: AlertServiceSubscriber): void {\n    this.subscribers.push(subscriber);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Creates and shows an {@link Alert} with color `warn`.\n   *\n   * @param{string} message The message of the alert\n   * @param{string} size The size of the alert\n   */\n  public warn(message: string, size = 'd'): void {\n    this.alert(message, size, 'warn');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Creates and shows an {@link Alert} with color `success`.\n   *\n   * @param{string} message The message of the alert\n   * @param{string} size The size of the alert\n   */\n  public success(message: string, size = 'd'): void {\n    this.alert(message, size, 'success');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Creates and shows an {@link Alert} with color `info`.\n   *\n   * @param{string} message The message of the alert\n   * @param{string} size The size of the alert\n   */\n  public inform(message: string, size = 'd'): void {\n    this.alert(message, size, 'info');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Creates and shows an {@link Alert} with color `primary`.\n   *\n   * @param{string} message The message of the alert\n   * @param{string} size The size of the alert\n   */\n  public primary(message: string, size = 'd'): void {\n    this.alert(message, size, 'primary');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Creates and shows an {@link Alert} with color `secondary`.\n   *\n   * @param{string} message The message of the alert\n   * @param{string} size The size of the alert\n   */\n  public secondary(message: string, size = 'd'): void {\n    this.alert(message, size, 'secondary');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Creates and shows an {@link Alert}.\n   *\n   * The `message`, `size` and `color` of the {@link Alert} can be specified as\n   * parameters.

options in the form of inputs or attributes.\nThere are two possible form changing options: round and pill. These can\nbe passed on either with attributes or with inputs. The input syntax is\ndifferent than the attribute syntax:\n\nround or pill for attribute syntax and\n[isPill]=\"{boolean}\" or [isRound]=\"{boolean}\" for the input syntax.\n\nYou cannot combine the two. Only one of these can be set to ture.\nThe other input / attribute is isPlain/plain. This tells the component\nto invert its colors, which means, that the hover colors are now 'normal'\ncolors and the 'normal' colors are now the hover colors.\n\n    \n\n    \n        Extends\n    \n
